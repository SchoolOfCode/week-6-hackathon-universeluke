// Write a function that takes an input year (from the start of the modern Olympic games in 1896)
// and returns either "Olympic year", "Winter Olympic year", or "Both Olympic and Winter Olympic year" (might have to Google the last one!)

// E.G: isModernOlympicYear(1896) should return "Olympic year"
// is ModernOlympicYear(1924) should return "Both Olympic and Winter Olympic year"

// If the input year is neither an Olympic or Winter Olympic Year, the function should throw an error with the message:
// "Error: Not either Olympic year"

// If a year was cancelled (due to WWI or WWII), then it should throw the error. Similarly, if it was postponed (like Tokyo 2020),
// then it should throw the error for the year that was cancelled, and should return "Olympic year" for the year that it was moved to

// While you could set up a database for me if you really wanted to, these anomalies can be hard-coded in your function for now
// Have fun! HAPPY HACKATHON <3
